# City-to-Nation Game Map (Fun-First, Data-Driven)

## Core Loop
1. Pick action cards for dramatic moves (quick wins, hidden costs).
2. Set cabinet levers for medium/long-term policy posture.
3. Respond to live crisis events with two hard choices.
4. Watch delayed consequences hit after 7-15 in-game days.
5. Complete missions to promote from City -> State -> Nation.

## Tier Structure

### Tier 1: City
- Fantasy: keep services alive under pressure.
- Focus systems: health, safety, integrity, debt control.
- Promotion requirement: complete city mission set.

### Tier 2: State
- Fantasy: coordinate infrastructure and climate at scale.
- Focus systems: economic momentum, climate resilience, fiscal discipline.
- Promotion requirement: complete state mission set.

### Tier 3: Nation
- Fantasy: govern long-run prosperity under external and political stress.
- Focus systems: stability, debt sustainability, institutional trust.
- End state: complete nation missions to win mandate.

## Why It Feels Like a Game
- Action cards create moment-to-moment choices and identity.
- Advisors provide friction and personality, not just numbers.
- Crisis events force tradeoffs under uncertainty.
- Mission board gives clear short-term goals and progression.
- Promotions unlock status and narrative momentum.

## Data-to-Mechanic Mapping
- Real indicators initialize baseline state and ranges.
- Direct series drive background drift (debt, employment, climate, integrity).
- Derived indicators fill sparse domains and remain explicitly flagged.
- Delayed effects represent real policy lag (service outcomes, leakage, resilience).

## Player Learning Outcome
- Players see how popular short-term moves can degrade long-term stability.
- Players learn that integrity and fiscal capacity amplify all other policies.
- Players learn that climate, health, and economy are connected systems.
